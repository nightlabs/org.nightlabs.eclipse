<p>
<a href="http://www.nightlabs.org/projects/pdfviewer">PDF viewer plug-in</a> for Eclipse-RCP-based applications.
</p>
<p>
This is the base package of the PDF viewer's extension plug-in. It contains some advanced UI elements - e.g. the
{@link org.nightlabs.eclipse.ui.pdfviewer.extension.editor.PdfViewerEditor} - for the easy integration into your application.
Because the UI elements in this plug-in are far more complex than the basic ones, this plug-in has more
dependencies (e.g. on <code>org.nightlabs.base.ui</code>).
